**Introduction**

In modern systems, event-driven data processing is a common method for building flexible, cost-effective, and scalable pipelines. This workshop guides you through building a complex event processing system triggered by Amazon S3, orchestrated by AWS Step Functions, and powered by AWS Lambda.

You will learn how to integrate various AWS services into a fully automated, serverless workflow that includes error control, retries, and full process tracking.

**Objectives**

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Set up triggers from Amazon S3 to initiate processing workflows upon file uploads.
- Build a chain of Lambda functions to handle data processing.
- Design workflows in AWS Step Functions with sequential, parallel, conditional, and error-handling states.
- Apply error-handling techniques including Retry, Catch, and Dead Letter Queues (DLQ).
- Monitor the entire system using CloudWatch Logs and Metrics.


**Hands-on Activities**

- Create an S3 bucket and configure event triggers on file upload.
- Write Lambda functions to process files (e.g., analyze metadata, send SNS messages).
- Create a Step Function to orchestrate multiple Lambda functions into a single workflow.
- Configure retry logic, handle exceptions, and send errors to SNS/SQS.
- Test and monitor via CloudWatch, verifying results through logs and Step Function state tracking.

**Expected Outcomes**

- Complete an automated event-processing system triggered by S3 uploads.
- Understand how event-driven architecture works within the AWS environment.
- Gain practical experience with serverless patterns and real-world error management techniques.
- Apply your knowledge to real scenarios like log processing, image resizing, or input data analysis.
